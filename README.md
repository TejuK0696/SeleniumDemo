Setup and Run Guide for Selenium Script

1. Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure the following software and dependencies are installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK):
Install JDK version 8 or above.
Ensure JAVA_HOME is set in your system's environment variables.
- Maven:
Install Maven for dependency management.
Verify installation by running mvn -version in the terminal.
- Selenium WebDriver:
Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome, GeckoDriver for Firefox) and place it in your system's PATH.
- TestNG:
Ensure TestNG is installed if you're using it for running the test cases.
- Browser:
Install the required browser (e.g., Chrome or Firefox) for executing the tests.

2. Cloning the Project
- Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone <repository-url>
- Navigate to the project directory:
cd <project-directory>

3. Configuring the Script
- Update the WebDriver Path:
In the script or configuration file, ensure the correct path to the WebDriver executable is specified.
Example for ChromeDriver:

System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/path/to/chromedriver");
- Update Test Data (if applicable):
If the script uses external data (e.g., CPT codes, URLs), ensure the correct data is provided in the script or configuration files.

4. Running the Script
- Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
Execute the script using Maven:
mvn test
- OR, if using TestNG, run the TestNG XML file:
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
- Observe Results:
The script will open the browser and perform the automation tasks.
The test results will be displayed in the terminal or in the target/surefire-reports directory.

5. Common Issues and Troubleshooting
- Driver Not Found:
Ensure the WebDriver is in the system PATH or the correct path is provided in the script.
Browser Version Mismatch:
- Update the WebDriver version to match the installed browser version.
Timeouts or Element Not Found Errors:
Verify the XPath/CSS selectors for the target elements.
Increase implicit or explicit wait times if necessary.

6. Enhancing the Script
Logging: Add logs using frameworks like Log4j to track script execution.
Reporting: Integrate with reporting tools like ExtentReports or Allure for detailed test reports.
CI/CD: Use tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the script execution pipeline.
